        <h1 class="heading">What is Covid-19?</h1>
        Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. <br>
        Most people infected with the virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment. <br>
        However, some will become seriously ill and require medical attention. <br>
        Older people and those with underlying medical conditions like cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease, or cancer are more likely to develop serious illness. <br> 
        Anyone can get sick with COVID-19 and become seriously ill or die at any age. <br><br> <hr>
